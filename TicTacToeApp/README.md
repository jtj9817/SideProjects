This is a basic Android app that allows the user to play TicTacToe without going against
an AI and no multiplayer functionality. Thus, the planned upgrades are to add multiplayer
functionality and allow the player to go against an AI. 

To run the app, simply run the "TicTacToe.apk" file on an Android emulator (either local or online by https://appetize.io).
