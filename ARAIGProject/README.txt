ARAIG Evaluation Control Software

- Designed a simple CLI software to be used by the ARAIG Simulation software of the Aviation education department of Seneca college

- Tasks were created to simulate potential flight paths with varying flight conditions. The ARAIG suit has integrated vibration sensors that can provide haptic feedback – the program utilizes the haptic feedback to simulate turbulence in the flight simulations.

- A profile feature for the ARAIG Simulation user is also created. The profile handles the definition of the flight plan simulation, execution, and user-related control of the suit. The profile stores the tasks for the user and has a simple interface to detail which tasks are completed, to-be-completed, and incomplete.
