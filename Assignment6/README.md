# Earthquake Events List 
An Android app that fetches a list of Earthquakes that recently happened from the USGS Earthquakes API. 
When an Earthquake item is selected from the list, it opens a web page from the USGS website that 
displays all the details pertaining to the selected Earthquake item. When the app is started, it gives
the user the option on how many Earthquake items should be fetched (with the default being 20 items).

# How To Run
To run the program simply download the "Assignment6.apk" file and run it on your Android emulator or upload the file to 
https://appetize.io/upload and follow the instructions on how to run it.
